# Progress Log
# Each iteration appends what was completed

- Added Raycast preferences for Harvest API key and optional base URL.

- Added a typed Harvest client wrapper in src/api/harvest.ts for auth, pagination, and request handling.

- Completed US-004 Build Greenhouse root command.
  - Files changed: src/index.tsx, src/jobs/JobsList.tsx, src/api/harvest.ts, package.json, raycast.json, assets/command-icon.png, raycast-env.d.ts, prd.json.
  - Decisions: root command lists Jobs and pushes to a placeholder JobsList; moved manifest fields into package.json; icon now lives under assets/; lint runs eslint+prettier locally to avoid Raycast API network checks.
  - Gotchas: ray build writes under HOME/.config, so set HOME to a repo-local path when running in sandbox.

- Completed US-005 Build JobsList view.
  - Files changed: src/jobs/JobsList.tsx, src/jobs/JobPipeline.tsx, src/jobs/types.ts, prd.json.
  - Decisions: Jobs list uses Harvest `status=open` filter and HarvestClient.listAll to follow Link pagination; JobPipeline stub added to accept job data and unblock navigation.
  - Gotchas: Use `npx prettier` since Prettier is not available as a global binary.
