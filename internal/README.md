# Internal Automation

This folder contains internal automation and agent workflows used for development.
These files are intentionally excluded from the public Raycast submission.

## Contents
- `AGENTS.md`: local environment and workflow conventions
- `PROMPT_build.md` / `PROMPT_plan.md`: agent prompts for build and plan modes
- `prompt.md`: main agent instruction set
- `loop.sh` / `ralph.sh`: automation loops

## Notes
- Artifacts like `.last-branch`, `archive/`, `ralph.log`, and `loop.log` are ignored.
- Keep public-facing docs in the repo root README only.
